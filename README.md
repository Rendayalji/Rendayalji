<h1 align="left">Hello👋, I'm Renuka</h1>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my final task based on Git version control for the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m enjoying learning Python 🐍 and making my code modular using functions, decorators and OOP.  
- 💻 Recently I have had an introduction to Web development using basic HTML syntax and elements to create the basic structure for a web page.
  Explored CSS fundamentals and applied them to the web page. 


**Why I enjoy coding**

🤖 My greatest satisfaction comes from doing things to a high standard and with accuracy.  This is why I love programming. I get a thrill from creating successful programs that are well-written for readability and efficiency considering all user responses.   As a teacher,  I have enjoyed teaching my pupils to write and test programs to achieve specific goals.  Coding has helped both myself and my pupils to improve logical thinking, collaborative learning and resilience.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the Software Engineering Bootcamp coding tasks for projects, as these have been opportunities to showcase the ability I have to successfully break large projects into steps, ensuring a great user experience free of errors and meeting the full requirements. Learning about error handling has been interesing and useful, enabling me to impliment these into my programs.  

📑 Now that I am nearing the completion of the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp, I plan to continue developing my understanding of Python, OOP and software testing.  I am passionate about pursuing a career in Software Testing ideally linked to educational or Environmental Science software testing so leveraging my Python knowledge, teaching experience and knowledge from my Environmental Science degree to make a difference. 

**My interests**

🌿 Capturing memories and the beauty of🌻 nature 🌷 through photography and appreciation of history 🏺, art 🖼️ and science 🦕 as
a Museumgoer 🏛️.  
🎵I love to listen to classical music 🎵

I would describe myself as self-motivated, and open to learning new things and asking questions. 
I get a great sense of fulfilment in helping others understand, learn, and develop confidence.  I guess that stems from my personal life experiences and various school-based roles, which I feel have shaped me into a reliant, empathetic person who understands pupils', colleagues' and parents' needs enabling effective engagement with them.
